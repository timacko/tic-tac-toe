# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### [game link](https://timacko.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

## Instructions

Each player has a turn to fill their symbol ("X" or "O") in one of the squares on the table, in the attempt to have three of them in a row.

Player 1's symbol is "X"
Player 2's symbol is "O"

**Hint:** If you're going first, then the best move you can make is to select  the centre box.  This will maximize your chances of winning, since you'll be able to create a row of three "X"s or "O"s in more combinations (4) this way than if you chose a different square.
